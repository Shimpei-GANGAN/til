### Testing in Android
- Without tests, you need to manually test the same functionality of your app over and over again to verify it is working.
- With JUnit, we can test our code with a single click whenerver we want.
- Unit tests - Integration Tests - UI Tests
- Unit tests: 70%
- Integration test: 20%
  - Tests how two components of our app work together
- UI tests: 10%
  - End to end test
