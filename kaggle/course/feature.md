## What is Feature Engineering?
In this course you'll learn about one of the most important steps on the way to building a great machine learning model: feature engineering. You'll learn how to:

- determine which features are the most important with *mutual information*
- inbent new features in several real-world problem domains
- encode high-cardinality categoricals with a *target encoding*
- create segmentation features with *K-means clustering*
- decompose a dataset's variation into features with *principal component analysis*

### The Goal of Feature Engineering
The goal of feature engineering is simply to make your data better suited to the problem at hand.
